The Second of May was due to have been our wedding day. As a result of what's happening globally, our plans have had to be postponed; church buildings are closed and paperwork isn't being issued. The implication is that it is not possible to get married in the morning. Even though we desperately want to make these commitments to each other, legally we are restricted.

For everyone, this season has been a period of real uncertainty; changing plans and further restrictions are desperately hard to navigate. But, in the midst of this time we are ever more certain that being married is something we want to commit to, and will do so as soon as it is permitted. Whether that be with two witnesses or two hundred witnesses, marriage is important and we want to honour it in our lives.

As with so much in this time, we don’t know when that will be, or how it will work. We are waiting. 

In many wedding ceremonies there is a reading taken from the Bible from the book of [1 Corinthians](https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/113/1CO.13.NIVUK). Paul, the author, teaches the definition of love. He starts with _‘Love is patient’_. Patient love is directed at one another, but it is also patience towards God. We are to have patience with God as He is at work. As many of you know, we are both Christians- we trust that God is in control at this time, and as we love Him, so we patiently wait, trusting in Him to bring us, and this world, through this.

The Second of May will be a sad day for us. But in the midst of the sadness we have hope; [as Paul writes to the church in Rome](https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/113/ROM.8.NIVUK), nothing will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus.

When we set our wedding date, we also created a gift list, which many of you have generously given on, thank you. If gift giving brings you joy, [we’ve left this open](https://www.weddingshop.com/Buy/View/68330). Sadly, the gift ordering service is currently closed until businesses re-open, meaning we may not receive your lovely gifts for a significant period of time. However, they are greatly appreciated! Alternatively, the good news is, we have a new postal address. If you prefer to put something in the mail, please let us know and we'll give you our address.
